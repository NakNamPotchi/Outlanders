<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Outlanders** is a casual, adventure, and strategy-focused tower defense mobile video game developed by a 4th-year Computer Science student from Arellano University â€“ Juan Sumulong Campus. The game combines fun gameplay with learning about **Philippine Literature**, specifically **Bugtong** (Riddles), **Alamat** (Legends), **Kwentong-bayan** (Folktales), and **Philippine Mythical Creatures**.

In **Outlanders**, players must use strategic thinking to place towers and defend against waves of Mooltos, mythical creatures threatening the land. By defeating enemies, players unlock new towers, collect pages of Philippine literature, and uncover lost tales. These tales provide valuable insights and abilities to help defeat future waves of Mooltos. Ultimately, the goal is to rescue **Lola** and protect the stories of the Philippines.

The game was developed using the following software tools:
- **Unity**: A versatile engine for both 2D and 3D graphics and scripting with C#.
- **Tiled**: Used to create the Game Stage Map with a preset tiled sheet.
- **Aseprite**: For creating 2D pixelated assets and animations.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Used for writing C# scripts.
- **Adobe Photoshop CC**: For designing assets like backgrounds and icons.
- **Android SDK**: Necessary for building and deploying the mobile game.
