<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Made by 4th Year Computer Science students of Arellano University â€“ Juan Sumulong Campus 

Outlanders is a casual, adventure and strategy focused tower defense mobile video game where students or players are able to learn about Philippine Literature. To be specific, Bugtong (Riddles), Alamat (Legends), Kwentong-bayan (Folktale), and Philippine Mythical Creatures. 

Players will need to strategize their tower placement in order to defeat armies of Mooltos and retrieve books that rewards the player with new unlockable towers or Philippine Literature pages and books that may provide help to the player in overcoming future hordes of Mooltos.  Uncover the lost tales, unite the races and defeat the invading Mooltos so you can rescue Lola.

The game is made using softwares such as Unity, an all-around engine that uses C# and an easy drag-and-drop feature, which also allows for 2D and 3D graphics and scripting. Tiled to create the Game Stage Map with a tiled sheet preset. Aseprite for making the 2D pixelated game assets or sprites including their animations. Visual Studio Code used to create C# scripts for the game. Adobe Photoshop CC for the designing of some game assets such as the background of game stages as well as the application icon; and Android SDK, libraries necessary in the development of the mobile video game.
